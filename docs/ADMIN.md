# Running the console: staff, access, integrations

Who can do what, how the panel is reached, and everything it can talk to.

## Finding a task

The console has six main navigation groups: Overview, Users, Nodes,
Subscriptions, Monitoring and Operations. On desktop, section headings group
always-visible common pages; only secondary settings and tools collapse.
Headings do not navigate. On phones, section buttons expand their pages, and
choosing a page closes the drawer. Secondary expansion survives navigation.
Settings stays at the bottom; account security is in the avatar menu.
Subscription profiles, templates and response rules have separate direct links
to the existing editor modes, with one active navigation item.

Settings is a directory, with separate pages for each editor. Registration and
trial rules are under Users; certificates, connection recording, audit and
speed policies under Nodes; subscription URLs, HWID and clients under
Subscriptions; collection, the public status page, ping tasks and heartbeat
under Monitoring; notices, referrals and purchase credit under Operations.
Global security, notification integrations and maintenance stay under Settings.
The directory search covers names and descriptions across these categories,
without loading configuration values. Moving a setting does not change its
admin-only API permission.

Editor URLs such as `/admin/settings/mail` can be bookmarked. Only the selected
editor loads its data. Unsaved changes survive background refreshes, and leaving
the editor asks whether to discard them. A failed initial load must be retried
before editing. User-group and monitoring tabs, and subscription template modes,
also keep their selection in the URL. Dashboard links preserve node, order and
asset filters in URLs as well. Existing page and API URLs remain valid.

Creating a user opens that user's detail drawer; granting a plan leaves it open
for subscription checks. Node details show connection, confirmed running
inbounds and enabled entries separately: an enabled entry is not proof of
end-to-end connectivity. An inbound's **Add entry** action carries its selection
into the entry editor. Alert rows link full administrators directly to the
node's existing network diagnostic form.

## Dashboard tasks

The dashboard places node issues and daily tasks before four business metrics,
the traffic chart and system maintenance checks. Offline nodes have paired but
not contacted Captain for three minutes; unpaired nodes are separate setup
tasks. Self-check failures describe the last reported check, and acknowledged
incidents remain unresolved until recovery. Asset reminders use each active
asset's UTC calendar date and reminder window, including overdue items. Pending
orders are payment status, not necessarily a manual intervention or a failure.

The existing `GET /api/admin/dashboard` adds an optional `attention` object.
Node, incident and asset counts require the source endpoint's role and API token
permission; omitted counts mean unavailable, never zero. No asset costs, notes,
node addresses or self-check output are included. Failed reads return an error;
the console marks any retained snapshot as stale and offers refresh. Traffic
labels use UTC to match accounting buckets; the current day is incomplete.

## User groups

Users → User groups lists and creates groups beside the user list and renewals
views. Assign a group in the user detail drawer or through a plan; inbound group
restrictions use the same groups. Admin and operator accounts can manage them;
support accounts cannot. The APIs remain `GET` and `POST /api/admin/groups`.

## Staff roles

Settings → Staff creates console accounts with a role:

| Role | Can |
|---|---|
| **admin** | everything |
| **operator** | everything except settings, system, staff, the landing page, and the audit rules and log — those write every node's core config and record where users went |
| **support** | tickets, plus read-only users, orders, plans and the dashboard. No connection log, no subscription links, and the user payloads leave the subscription token out |

Console accounts (`staff`) and customers (`users`) are separate tables in the
same SQLite database. Each has its own ID sequence: on a new installation,
admin 1 and customer 1 are different accounts. Creating staff does not consume
customer IDs. The same email may be used once in each table, with independent
passwords, sessions and OIDC links. Staff accounts have no proxy UUID or
subscription token; to use a subscription, create a customer and assign or
purchase a plan. Console credentials and cookies cannot access the portal.

Migration 52 preserves existing customer IDs, UUIDs and subscription URLs,
and moves staff passwords, TOTP, API tokens and OIDC links to the console
namespace. Valid console sessions survive; old staff sessions issued by the
portal are revoked. If a former staff account has orders, subscriptions,
balance or other customer history, that history remains attached to a disabled
customer with no password. It cannot sign in or use a subscription until an
administrator deliberately enables it; password login also needs a new
customer password. Staff without customer history is removed from `users` entirely. Existing databases
are not renumbered; restore the pre-upgrade snapshot to roll back this schema.

The last admin cannot be demoted, disabled or deleted.

**Delete a customer** — accounts referenced by orders, commissions or other
users' `invited_by` links cannot be deleted, to preserve that history. Keep
them banned instead. This also applies to disabled customer records retained
when staff accounts were separated. The delete API returns 409 with an
explanation; the console shows it in the selected language. Deleting an
eligible customer does not affect a staff account with the same ID or email.

**Change an account ID** — the customer detail drawer and the staff edit
dialog each have a separate Change ID control. Only the `admin` role can
use it, including for its own account. Choose an unused positive integer up
to 9007199254740991; customer and staff IDs are checked in their own namespaces.
An ID still referenced by another account's historical records is reserved.
The operation preserves subscription URLs, proxy credentials, balances,
orders, invitations, history, sessions, API tokens and two-factor setup.
Scripts using the numeric account ID must use the new ID for later requests.

The API is `PUT /api/admin/users/{id}/id` for customers or
`PUT /api/admin/admins/{id}/id` for staff, with `{"id":42}` as the request
and response body. Invalid IDs return 400, missing accounts 404 and occupied
IDs 409. As with all staff management, a cookie session is required for the
staff endpoint; API tokens cannot call it. Node accounting uses a separate
immutable identity, so pending traffic reports cannot be billed to a new
owner of the old account ID.

**Two-factor sign-in** — Account security → Two-factor authentication: each staff
account can add a TOTP authenticator, and the console then asks for the
code after the password. Re-enrolling requires the current code. The replay
guard is keyed on the step that matched, so the next code still works. API
tokens are unaffected.

## API tokens and MCP

Account security → API tokens & MCP issues personal bearer tokens (`cap_…`) for the
admin API and for AI agents. Captain serves the Model Context Protocol at
`POST /mcp` with tools for nodes, users, plans, orders, tickets, the probe
and TCPing; write tools require `confirm: true`. See [MCP.md](MCP.md).

A token carries its owner's role, narrowed by what it was issued with:

- **scope** — *read-only* answers only GET requests, and only the MCP read
  tools;
- **expiry** — 30, 90 or 365 days, after which it stops working on its own;
- staff accounts can never be managed with a token: `/api/admin/admins`
  needs the interactive login;
- `/mcp` sits behind the same admin allow-list as `/api/admin`, so an agent
  or a scraper has to come from an allowed address too.

## Access control and the client address

- **Admin allow-list** — Settings → Staff and site security → Console access control
  (`admin_allow_cidrs`: bare addresses or CIDRs) restricts the admin login,
  every `/api/admin` route including API tokens, and `/mcp`. Saving a list
  that would exclude your own address is refused.
- **Login throttling** — five failed sign-ins from one address within
  15 minutes lock that address for 15 minutes. The counter includes the
  TOTP step, and it lives in memory: a restart clears it.
- **Browser origin check** — cookie-authenticated writes (console, portal,
  and the login / register / reset routes) must carry an `Origin` or
  `Referer` of the panel's own host, so a page on another site cannot drive
  the API with a victim's session even where `SameSite=Lax` would let the
  cookie through. `Authorization: Bearer` requests and reads are exempt.
- **Session kinds** — customer sessions (password, OIDC or password reset)
  never reach `/api/admin`, and console sessions cannot enter authenticated
  `/api/portal` routes. Console sign-in uses the staff namespace, with TOTP
  when enabled. Changing a password drops only that account's sessions.
- **Which address is "yours"** — behind a proxy, `X-Forwarded-For` read
  from the right, skipping trusted proxies. The full rules, and how to
  configure `trusted_proxies`, are in
  [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md#admin-access-allow-list-and-client-addresses).

## Theme and page injection

Admin → Landing page: primary colour, corner radius, light/dark/system
scheme for the portal and the landing page, portal title, font, and raw HTML
injected before `</head>` and `</body>` on every portal and landing page
(analytics, chat widgets). The console keeps its own look.

## Event webhooks

Settings → Notifications and integrations → Event webhooks: Captain POSTs JSON to your URLs with
`X-Captain-Event` and an HMAC-SHA256 `X-Captain-Signature` over the body,
retrying a failed delivery three times. This is the integration point for
n8n, a script or a CRM, in place of an in-process plugin system that a
single static binary cannot load.

Events: `user.registered`, `order.paid`, `ticket.created`,
`ticket.replied`, `withdrawal.requested`, `subscription.expiring`,
`subscription.traffic`, `user.first_connected`, `user.not_connected`,
`user.audit_hit`, `user.audit_banned`, `user.throttled`, `node.alert`.
Payload stability is part of the 1.x promise — see
[COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Support, knowledge base, Telegram

- **Tickets** — users open tickets in the portal (priority low / normal /
  high) and reply in a thread; Admin → Tickets answers them. A reply
  reaches the user on Telegram when linked, otherwise by mail, and new
  tickets can ping the admin chat.
- **Knowledge base and downloads** — Admin → Knowledge base holds Markdown
  guides grouped by category, with `{{sub_url}}`, `{{email}}` and
  `{{site_name}}` substituted per reader; Subscriptions → Client downloads lists
  the apps. Both appear under Help in the portal.
- **Telegram bot** — Settings → Notifications and integrations → Telegram: paste a BotFather token, and your
  chat id for order, ticket and node notices. Users link their chat from
  the portal with a one-time `/bind CODE`; the bot answers `/sub`,
  `/status`, `/unbind`, `/id` and delivers expiry, traffic and ticket
  notices. Plain Bot API long polling — no webhook, no public URL. One bot
  token cannot be shared with a bosun panel (Telegram allows one
  `getUpdates` consumer).

## Mail

Settings → Notifications and integrations → Mail: SMTP (any provider; port 587 STARTTLS, 465 TLS or 25
plain) or the Resend HTTP API for hosts that block mail ports, plus a
"send test email" button. With mail configured, registration can require an
emailed code, users can reset their own password, and the hourly job sends
the expiry and traffic-threshold reminders.

**Mail language** — the same picker row chooses the language of the mail
users receive: English (the default), 简体中文, 繁體中文, 日本語, Русский or
한국어. It is a separate choice from the console's language, which each
staff member picks in their own browser, because this mail goes to
customers. The messages are deliberately short — a code, a date, a
percentage and at most one button — and live in `internal/mail/lang.go`
if you want to reword them or add a language.

## External login (OIDC)

Settings → Staff and site security → External login takes any OpenID Connect provider (Casdoor,
Authentik, Keycloak, Zitadel, Google …): id, display name, issuer URL,
client id and secret. Register
`https://<your domain>/api/oauth/<id>/callback` as the redirect URI at the
provider.

The portal then shows "Continue with …". Accounts are matched by the
provider's subject, linked to an existing account with the same verified
email, or created when registration is open (or `auto_register` is set for
that provider). Users link and unlink logins from the portal home page, and
password login can be switched off entirely.

Casdoor example: issuer `https://door.example.com`, default scopes
(`openid profile email`), `trust_email: true` since you run it yourself.

## Backups

Captain snapshots its database once a day with `VACUUM INTO`, so the copy is
consistent while the panel keeps serving, into `<data_dir>/backups`, keeping
the newest seven. Settings → Backups and maintenance → Database backups sets the hour and retention,
adds a remote (WebDAV with basic auth, or any S3-compatible bucket: AWS,
Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, MinIO with path-style) that receives each
snapshot gzipped with its own retention, tests the remote, runs a backup on
demand and downloads local copies. Remote copies can be encrypted with age:
generate a key pair in the card (the private key is shown once and never
stored) or set a passphrase. An encrypted copy carries `config.yaml` beside
the database, so one file rebuilds a panel; `captain backup open` writes
both back out.

Restore, upgrade and rollback procedures — including the `-wal`/`-shm`
caveat that silently corrupts a careless restore — are in
[OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md).

## Reset site

Settings → Backups and maintenance → Reset site starts Captain over with an empty business database.
Only an active **admin** using a console cookie session can preview or execute
it; operator/support accounts, customer sessions and API tokens cannot. The
confirmation dialog shows affected record counts, requires the current password,
a fresh authenticator code when TOTP is enabled, and the exact text `RESET`.
Failed credential attempts share the sign-in rate limit.

- Deletes customers, other staff, plans, orders, subscriptions, balances, node
  records, entries, panel-managed certificates, history and all database settings.
  Old sessions, API tokens, subscription URLs and node pairings stop working.
- Recreates the calling admin as ID 1 with the same email, password and enabled
  TOTP. The first new customer is ID 1 independently. Everyone must sign in again;
  the reset itself becomes the first new admin audit entry.
- Preserves the database schema/migration version and all deployment files:
  `config.yaml`, the panel's HTTPS certificates, ACME files, custom static site
  files and existing local/remote backups. External DNS records are untouched.
  Configuration supplied in `config.yaml`, including payment gateways, remains
  in effect. This is not an uninstall or secure erasure of historical backups.
- **Remote bosun processes and cached configurations are not cleared.** They can
  continue serving existing users after losing the panel connection. Stop or
  clean up those nodes first; then create new node records and pair again.
  When node records exist, both the dialog and API require acknowledgement of
  this condition.

Take and download any backup you need **before** confirming. The reset does not
make an automatic backup. Database cleanup, ID sequences and the retained admin
are committed in one transaction; a database failure rolls the whole operation
back. In-flight requests and jobs complete before resetting, and cached account
and node state is discarded before new requests proceed. Long polls recheck their
node token, including after a node ID is reused.

`GET /api/admin/system/reset` returns counts for `users`, `staff`, `nodes`,
`plans`, `orders` and `subscriptions`. `POST` to the same path accepts
`{"password":"…","code":"…","confirmation":"RESET","nodes_acknowledged":true}`
and returns `{"ok":true,"admin_id":1}`. `code` is required only with TOTP;
`nodes_acknowledged` must be true when nodes exist. Success expires the cookie
and the console returns to sign-in. No process restart is required.

## Interface languages

The console and the portal ship in 简体中文, 繁體中文, English, 日本語,
Русский and 한국어. Every locale file is checked for parity in CI, and a key
the sources use but no locale defines fails the build.

## Additions in 1.8.0

Staff Passkeys, scoped API tokens, user filtering/bulk operations and private metadata are described in [administration workflows](ADMIN_WORKFLOWS.md).
